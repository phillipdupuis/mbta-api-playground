# MBTA API Playground

This is a website for learning how to interact with the MBTA V3 API.

Users can build queries in which they customize:
* The primary object
* What additional objects will be included
* What attributes should be returned for each object
* Filters

Upon executing a query, the user is brought to a results page where they can view:
* A brief summary of the response (status code, size, and query parameters)
* A table of the response data.
    * It can be downloaded as a CSV file for further analysis.
* A profile report generated by [pandas-profiling](https://github.com/pandas-profiling/pandas-profiling)
    * Users can customize what correlations are calculated.
* The raw response data as pretty-printed JSON
* Bokeh geographical plots of locations
